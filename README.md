A cihibi manager/spawner for wayland using RUST and GTK4
DISCLAIMER: This is AI generated code, your choice if you want to use it, or perhaps make your own version!

- You can spawn and despawn as many chibis as you like.
- PNG and GIF formats work (but gifs wont play).
- You can choose to have them just on the desktop, or above everything.
- You can enable click though, which makes them hide on mouse over for 3 seconds.
- You can enable drag mode and move them wherever you like.
