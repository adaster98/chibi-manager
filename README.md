- You can spawn and despawn as many chibis as you like.
- PNG and GIF formats work (but gifs wont play).
- You can choose to have them just on the desktop, or above everything.
- You can enable click though, which makes them hide on mouse over for 3 seconds.
- You can enable drag mode and move them wherever you like.
- You can save them (stored in .config) so you can respawn them later on.

Make sure you have `GTK4` and `gtk4-layer-shell` installed for this to work!
Tray icon might not show for GNOME users, install AppIndicator Support Extension. Should work fine with waybar and such.
